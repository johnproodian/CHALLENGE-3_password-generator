# Password Generator

This application generates a random password based on criteria selected by the user.

Specifically, the apps requirements were:
* present the user with a series of prompts for password criteria (password length, character types) when they clicked the button,
* validate the input so that at least one character type was selected,
* generate a random password that matched the selection criteria,
* display the password on the page
