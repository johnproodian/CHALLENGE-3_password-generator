# Password Generator Challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to create an application that an employee could use to generate a random password based on criteria they selected. 

Specifically, the app needed to:
* present that user with a series of prompts for password criteria (password length, character types) when they clicked the button
* validate the input so that at least one character type was selected 
* generate a random password that matched the selection criteria
* display the password on the page

## Built With

* JavaScript (my contribution)
